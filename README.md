# SudokuDesktop 
A desktop application for the CompleteSudoku Project. 
This is used to design and test the Sudoku algorithms and gameplay.
## Installation
This program uses JavaFX for the GUI and therefore requires having Java 8 installed.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/David-Lerner/SudokuDesktop
cd SudokuDesktop/src
javac *.java
cd ..
java -cp src Main
```
Alternatively, using an IDE like Eclipse, create a new Java project from an existing git repo by importing from https://github.com/David-Lerner/SudokuDesktop
